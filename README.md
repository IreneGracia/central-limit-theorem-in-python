# central-limit-theorem-in-python

This Notebook uses the seaborn tips dataset to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) graphically and numerically. The CLT is then applied to calculate the probability that the cumulative sum of tips from 100 randomly selected samples exceeds Â£350, using the probability distribution function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) from the scipy.stats.norm tool, and the z score.
