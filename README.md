# central-limit-theorem-in-python

This notebook uses the seaborn tips dataset to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) graphically and numerically. The CLT is then used to calculate the probability that the cumulative sum of tips from 100 randomly selected samples exceeds Â£350, using the scipy.stats.norm.pdf tool and the z score.
